We were determined to be super puppy parents!</p><p>One thing that almost every dog trainer recommended was to <strong>record everything your puppy does</strong> for at least the first few weeks.</p><p class="font-bold">Why did so many trainers recommend this?</p><p>Well, in addition to being impossibly cute, puppies are exceptionally needy! Not enough food or sleep? Good luck controlling that little ball of energy. Not enough bathroom breaks throughout the day? Have fun cleaning up messes constantly.</p><p class="font-bold">If you try to do it from memory, you'll learn pretty quick how easy it is to forget...</p><p class="text-gray-600"><i>"Did the puppy wake up 30 minutes ago, or an hour ago? Is it time for another potty break? How many times have they pooped today? Have they had enough exercise already? Is it time for another nap?"</i></p><p><strong>This can quickly get out of hand,</strong> so it's important to write down every time your puppy eats, sleeps, plays, or uses the bathroom so that you can <strong>set your puppy up for success.</strong></p><p>For my puppy, I kept track of this on a basic notes app on my phone. It worked...<i>okay-ish</i>. Typing every line out by hand wasn't terrible, but it wasn't convenient either, especially when holding my phone in one hand and the leash of a wild puppy in another. Writing just one entry -- date, time, category, custom notes -- took at least a minute or two each time. It was tedious enough that it soon became easy to forget...or to put it off until later. It wasn't long before the puppy log fell by the wayside.</p><p>At the time, I wished I had a tool where I could track every puppy activity with the tap of a button. <strong>That's why I made this tool.</strong> It's a simple, no frills solution to logging your puppies' daily activities. It's meant to get out of your way and to do one thing very well. It isn't some fancy web service running in the cloud, requiring yet another username and password to remember, taking your data and doing who-knows-what with it. All your data stays on your device. Maybe one day this tool will evolve into something more advanced, but for now, the beauty is in the simplicity.</p><p>I hope you enjoy this tool and that it helps you through your new puppy journey and beyond!</p><h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Meet the team</h2><p class="text-gray-600"><i>Maybe "team" is a stretch...</i></p><p>My name is Josh. I am a software engineer by day, dog parent and code tinkerer by night. I made this site by myself in a weekend and have been adding small improvements here and there. It's been a fun little side project!</p><p>If you want to support this project, keep an eye out for a virtual tip jar coming soon!</p><p class="text-gray-600">Thanks for using Puppy Logger‚Äîhappy logging!</p></main><footer class="w-full max-w-md text-center text-xs text-gray-500 mt-8"><p class="mt-2">&copy; 2025 Joshua Palmer.
