        Just like infants, puppies need ample sleep for healthy development
        and growth. Frequent, scheduled naps help puppies process new
        experiences, reduce anxiety, and maintain good behavior throughout
        the day.

        The Importance of Logging Your Puppy's Activities

        One of the keys to ensuring your puppy grows into a happy,
        well-adjusted dog is establishing a consistent routine. But routines
        don't just happen; they're carefully crafted by observing and
        understanding your puppy's natural tendencies and body clock.
